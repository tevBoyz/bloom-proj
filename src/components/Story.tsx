                  “Before BLOOM, I spent 6–7 hours a day manually pulping coffee cherries. 
                  My hands hurt, my back ached, and I still couldn't reach market quality. 
                  I often had to choose between farm work and helping my children with homework.”

                <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  Almaz grew up helping her family cultivate their small coffee plot in 
                  Limmu Woreda. Like many Ethiopian women, she carried the heaviest 
                  workload yet had little control over farm decisions or income.
                </p>
                <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed">
                  When the BLOOM program launched, she was selected as a Team Coordinator. 
                  Over six months of training, she learned how to operate and maintain the 
                  Bloom Unit, manage finances, improve coffee quality, and lead a team with confidence.

                  “Now I process coffee in under 2 hours. Buyers come directly to me 
                  because the quality is high. I tripled my income and sent my eldest daughter 
                  to secondary school. Other women ask me to train them — I’m no longer just 
                  a farmer's wife. I’m a leader and a businesswoman.”

                  Almaz’s Bloom Team now serves 15 neighboring farmers, earning service fees 
                  that supplement their own income. She sits on her cooperative board and 
                  mentors new Bloom Teams. Her success demonstrates how technology, skills, 
                  and opportunity can reshape communities from the ground up.
